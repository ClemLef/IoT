# Internet of Things

This course will enable you to acquire advanced knowledge, get a deep understanding, and show programming skills in Internet of Things protocols, in particular their design, usages, the problems they solve, and their implementations. This course also aims to challenge the student in creating protocol implementations from scratch, to develop the student's programming skills even further.

After the course you should be able to:

- Describe and relate of how networking applications work and are designed.
- Describe and relate for what the Internet of Things is and its problems.
- Design and construct an implementation from given protocol specifications.
- Implement protocols from scratch with only basic programming tools and without the use of external libraries.
- Quantitatively evaluate your own implementation.
- Present and report the results from programming oriented projects.

Detailed course contents:

- Principles of distributed applications: client/server, peer-to-peer, multicast, etc.
- Principles of advanced programming and network programming: sockets, event-driven programs, multithreading, state machines, etc.
- Principles of the Internet of Things and its usages in practice.
- Design and implementation of IoT protocols. For example: REST, MQTT, CoAP, etc.
